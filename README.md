# Real-time sensor data visualization (GUI)

Tk-driven GUI to display (in two views, list and graph), a real-time data feed
from remote sensors, written in Python (using `tkinter`). This is a prototype
featuring thread-separated I/O, and is under development.

## TODO

- [x] Separate I/O into two threads
- [x] Real-time list view
- [ ] Graph view
